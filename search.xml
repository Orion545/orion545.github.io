    <content type="text"><![CDATA[TPO 52 ReadingScore: 28/30 with correction rate 39/42 For the vocabulary part, sometimes I still meet words that I am not familiar with. If this happens, it is of the most importance to examine the word in the original text. When reading history topic passages, never let go of any sentence, since some questions might be asking for them. TPO 51 ReadingScore: 29/30 with correction rate 40/42 Why, most my mistakes are on vocabulary tasks…… Seems that most of other types are not a problem for me anymore, except the last ques in every passage. Sometimes I need to double check if a choice is A MINOR ONE or A MAJOR ONE. Vocabulary mistakes are still making me frustrated. How on earth am I able to distinguish ‘permanently’ and ‘extensively’ when both are to replace ‘drastically’? Why, the answer told me it is extensively! The only thing I can do is try to put them back into the text and try reading them again and again. Hope this works. TPO 40 ReadingScore: 30/30 with correction rate 42/42 Nothing to say, too easy.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[TPO 53 ReadingScore: 30/30, correction 41/42 Not a single problem exists. I guess my concept of ‘check every word of its presence in the passage’ works well. This reading is relatively easy. Although one history and another anthropology passage is included, these two ones only consist of elementary reasonings, so the entire difficulty is significantly cut, since most times history topics plays the role of the boss. TPO 53 ListeningScore:30/30, correction 33/33 Nothing to say. This TPO is extremely easy…… Writing Phrase PracticeThis week I began to use Quizlet for my vocabulary practice. Up to now this app feels well for me. I use the Spelling function on the IOS app. The practice contains 7 words for a round. Faults will result in a word appearing again in later rounds. I’ve finished 22 rounds by now, which seems adequate .]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[TPO Reading 48Harder than expected, got only 25/30 with 37/42 correction rate. Main mistakes are the last question of each passage. I find it important that in TOFEL test, a correct choice will always be correct, and every word of it will be correct as well.Therefore it’s quite essential to check every statement in a choice thoroughly in the passage. Even if it seems obvious, it may not be a major idea or has some minor misunderstanding from the original text. For some topics(Paleontology for example), it is usual that specific words may confuse you, since they might be professional nouns of that certain topic. In this situation, I think it is better not to focus on the precise definition of the word, but only take it as a name like John or Kate. By that way, maybe I can take the word as x in equations: focus on its qualities, so that the questions are well answered. TPO Reading 47Done just after TPO48, got 29/30 with 40/42 correction rate. I guess this score was mainly because of my good status after finishing TPO48 :) Still the same cautious point: check every word of a choice to see if it is correct. TPO Listening 48Medium level, got 28/30 with 33/34 correction rate. The only mistake was a single choice, and the reason of it must be blamed to my carelessness. I guess there won’t be much problem on this listening. More to discussJust started to use Quizlet on tackling with my writing phrase usage. Felt great about this app on the first glance, got fascinated by its design and its use of ML. Might be inspirational to me!]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Overall ScoresMaterial: TPO 49 Reading: 28/30 Listening: 25/30 ReadingI made more mistakes than I expected. For 3-6 multiple choice problems, it is important to focus on the BEGINNING SENTENCE that was given in the problem. If a choice is absolutely correct but has nothing to do with it, then is can’t be chosen ListeningSame as reading part. Taking down less note might be comfortable, but at most times important info would be lost. ALWAYS take notes on reasons described. These are vital info for multiple answers.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Material Used:TPO 54, Reading + Listening Total Points:Reading 29/30 (40/41) Listening 25/30 (30/34) Tips &amp; InspirationsReadingNothing really important, just need to do some more vocabulary. When placing sentences, MIND their association with the sentence that is going to be behind it: most time there will be some relationship. Listening Not a pretty good score, but scarcely acceptable, I think. Theatre-based conversations/lectures are one of my hradships, should practice more on it, or learn some basic knowledge about this topic. Most Problems are limited to s certain part of the speech, so NEVER interfere with other parts when choosing. Still that same philosophy: take choices as ABSOLUTE ones instead of a mild opinion.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Solution of LOJ3089]]></title>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Problem Statementlink to loj.ac Main IdeasThe Answer looks like a product of different items under a sqrt, therefore a basic tecnique is to use ln. After this, calculation of product is changed to calculation of sum, which looks like: \sqrt[n]{\prod_i a_i}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_i\log_ba_iNow the problem is to seek the maximum average value of gem sequences that match the model string. When a problem of strings contains ONE model and MANY patterns, AC Automaton should come to one’s mind at once! We build the AC Automaton for the model string, and do dynamic programming on it, thus the problem should be solved. MIND that each node on the AC Automaton should inherit all the information of its ancestors on the fail-pointer tree. When a problem that asks for minimize/maximize the average for a certain set of values, Linear Programming should come to one’s mind at once! Assume that the average for the current set of model strings is $C$, it is obvious that we can do binary search to determine its value. Then if there is a set of {w} that results in an average larger than $C$, the following expression should be true: \frac{1}{siz}\sum_{i=1}^{siz}w_i\geq C\sum_{i=1}^{siz}w_i\geq C\ast siz\sum_{i=1}^{siz}(w_i-C)\geq 0Now we can use the sign of the largest possibel {w} to determine if the current C is the answer. The benefit of this algorithm is that we can delete one dimension of our DP on the AC Automaton, thus the Complexity is divided by n We assume dp[u][i] represents this state: iteration on the first i characters of the model string has been finished, and the pointer on AC Automaton is at node u If the next character of the model string is fixed, we simply update the value for dp[sonu(str[i+1])][i+1], else we’ll have to update all values of dp[son_u(0…9)][i+1] For more Details, refer to the code Copy Code123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960616263646566676869707172737475767778798081828384858687888990919293949596979899100101102103104105106107108109110111112113114115116117118/*------------------------------Author: Orion545Date: 2019/05/16Time: 157 min------------------------------*/#include&lt;iostream&gt;#include&lt;cstdio&gt;#include&lt;cstring&gt;#include&lt;algorithm&gt;#include&lt;cassert&gt;#include&lt;queue&gt;#include&lt;cmath&gt;#define ll long longusing namespace std;inline int read()&#123; int re=0,flag=1;char ch=getchar(); while(!isdigit(ch))&#123; if(ch=='-') flag=-1; ch=getchar(); &#125; while(isdigit(ch)) re=(re&lt;&lt;1)+(re&lt;&lt;3)+ch-'0',ch=getchar(); return re*flag;&#125;int n,m;double w[1510];char a[1510],s[1510][1510];int ch[1510][10],cntn=0,num[1510],fail[1510];double sum[1510];//AC Automatoninline void insert(int x,int len)&#123; int i,cur=0,tmp; for(i=1;i&lt;=len;i++)&#123; tmp=s[x][i]-'0'; if(!ch[cur][tmp]) ch[cur][tmp]=++cntn; cur=ch[cur][tmp]; &#125; num[cur]++;sum[cur]+=w[x];&#125;queue&lt;int&gt;q;inline void build()&#123; int i,u,v; for(i=0;i&lt;10;i++)&#123; if(!ch[0][i]) continue; q.push(ch[0][i]);fail[ch[0][i]]=0; &#125; while(!q.empty())&#123; u=q.front();q.pop(); num[u]+=num[fail[u]]; sum[u]+=sum[fail[u]]; for(i=0;i&lt;10;i++)&#123; v=ch[u][i]; if(v) fail[v]=ch[fail[u]][i],q.push(v); else ch[u][i]=ch[fail[u]][i]; &#125; &#125;&#125;//Dynamic Programmingdouble dp[1510][1510];int from[1510][1510][2],endpos;inline bool check(double mid)&#123; int i,j,k,son; for(i=0;i&lt;=n;i++) for(j=0;j&lt;=cntn;j++) dp[i][j]=-2e20; for(i=0;i&lt;=cntn;i++)&#123; sum[i]-=mid*(double)num[i];//cut the value according to binary search process &#125; dp[0][0]=0; for(i=1;i&lt;=n;i++)&#123; for(j=0;j&lt;=cntn;j++)&#123; if(dp[i-1][j]==-2e20) continue; if(a[i]!='.')&#123;//character is fixed in original S son=ch[j][a[i]-'0']; if(dp[i][son]&lt;dp[i-1][j]+sum[son])&#123; dp[i][son]=dp[i-1][j]+sum[son]; from[i][son][0]=j;//record the source of the maximum value from[i][son][1]=a[i]-'0';//record the corresponding character &#125; &#125; else&#123;//character is unfixed for(k=0;k&lt;10;k++)&#123; son=ch[j][k]; if(dp[i][son]&lt;dp[i-1][j]+sum[son])&#123; dp[i][son]=dp[i-1][j]+sum[son]; from[i][son][0]=j; from[i][son][1]=k; &#125; &#125; &#125; &#125; &#125; int pos=0; for(i=1;i&lt;=cntn;i++) if(dp[n][i]&gt;dp[n][pos]) pos=i; for(i=0;i&lt;=cntn;i++) sum[i]+=mid*(double)num[i];//repair the value cut endpos=pos;return dp[n][pos]&gt;0;//determine if largest value is over zero&#125;char re[1510];int main()&#123; n=read();m=read();int i; scanf("%s",a+1); for(i=1;i&lt;=m;i++)&#123; scanf("%s",s[i]+1); w[i]=read(); w[i]=log((double)w[i]); insert(i,strlen(s[i]+1)); &#125; build(); double l=0,r=log(1e9+7),mid,ans=0; while(r-l&gt;1e-6)&#123;//binary search mid=(l+r)*0.5; if(check(mid)) ans=mid,l=mid; else r=mid; &#125; check(ans); for(i=n;i&gt;=1;i--)&#123;//get the answer string re[i]=from[i][endpos][1]+'0'; endpos=from[i][endpos][0]; &#125; for(i=1;i&lt;=n;i++) putchar(re[i]); putchar('\n');&#125;]]></content>
